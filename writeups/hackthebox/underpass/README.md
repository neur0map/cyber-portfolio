I added the address to /etc/hosts 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

sudo nano /etc/hosts

10.10.11.48        underpass.htb

After investigating what the ports were and meant i researched commands to get information out of the ports and i ran.

```sql
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.10.11.48
```

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) collects and organizes information about devices on IP networks for monitoring and management.

The `snmpwalk` command retrieves SNMP information through chained GETNEXT requests.

Flag meanings:

- `-v2c`: Uses SNMP version 2c for improved error handling and bulk retrieval
- `-c public`: Uses 'public' as the default read-only access password

After investigating what daloradius server is i found common login credentials and i tried to open the site underpass.htb/daloradius but it took no where

I ran ferofoxer, read it works better than gobuster

```sql
feroxbuster -u http://underpass.htb/daloradius -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50
```

I tried each address and underpass.htb/daloradius/app/operators/ worked, it took me to a login page where i tested the default passwords first and got access to the server (app/users/ also has login but credentials didnt work)

Once inside you can see the user and password but its encrypted

Running hashid on the hash to see if would give me possible hash types it game quite a few so i started from the bottom MD2 didnt work and luckly i didnt have to go down too much, MD5 worked.
and i ran

![image.png](Underpass%20-%20total%20time%202%20days%201df5b4e7124c80a390c7c6bdabe5c330/image%206.png)

```sql
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

- `-m 0`: Specifies MD5 hash mode
- `-a 0`: Sets attack mode to straight/dictionary attack
- `hash.txt`: Input file containing the hash to crack
- `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`: Path to the wordlist file used for cracking

After getting the password I can try connecting to the ssh which it worked

```sql
ssh svcMosh@underpass.htb
password:underwaterfriends
```

User flag was right there with ls and cat command

Getting privilage escalation was difficult as always but extensive research i found a solution

```sql
sudo -l
```

The `sudo -l` command lists the sudo privileges for the current user, showing what commands they can run with elevated permissions.

then

```sql
sudo /usr/bin/mosh-server
```

this showed the mosh server id and port, which after researching i found an exploit https://medium.com/@momo334678/mosh-server-sudo-privilege-escalation-82ef833bb246

after using the found exploit i was finally able to gain root and get the flag
